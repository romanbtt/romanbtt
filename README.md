### Welcome to my Github human! &nbsp;

I'm a computer science student who is finding his path on the journey of being a software dev. I'm a leaner enthusiast who is believing learning is a big part of life that doesn't stop at the end of the university. I spare my life between France, Canada, and Brasil. I'm able to speak several languages to communicate with humans and computers. I did my first year of computer science university in Paris. I'm continuing my studies at 42 in Sao Paulo. 42 is a school that allows me to learn in the way that I am the most effective.
