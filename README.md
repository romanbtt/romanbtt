I'm a computer science student who is finding it's path on the journey of being a software dev 🤑 💰. I'm a leaner enthousiam who believe that every period of the life is good to learn something new 🤸‍♂️. I spare my life between France, Canada and Brasil 🛂. I'm able to speak several languages to communicate with humans and computers 🤖. I did my first year of computer science univerty in Paris 🥐 and i'm continuing my studies at 42 school in Sao Paulo 🏖️. 42 allows me to learn in the way that I am the most effective 🤯.
